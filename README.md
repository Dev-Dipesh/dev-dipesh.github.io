**:heavy_exclamation_mark: A Note Regarding Pull Requests :**
Please keep your commits targeted and in a logical fashion in order to keep code review and merges as clean as possible. Generally commits shouldn't be a "save" for authors. Multiple commits sent via a PR can also create chaos when doing something like a ``git bisect`` later on. Rebasing commits from a repo where other contributors have acces can cause major conflicts for those tracking the project through a fork.
