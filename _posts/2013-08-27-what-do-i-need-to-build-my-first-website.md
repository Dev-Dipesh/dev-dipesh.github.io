Introduction
Most new users that join our group have no idea nor background on how to start their own websites whatsoever. They start making some courses because they believe that is going to help them, but even then when they finish they have no idea where and how to apply that knowledge, thus making no idea how to create a website. Here we will tackle those problems in order to give you a path to follow. Thus, I propose to answer the following questions in this article:

What is the type of my Website?
What do I need to know to make my Website? What knowledge to I need?
What tools should I use to make my Website?
Where do I make my Website available to the world?
Are there any easier ways to make a Website?
