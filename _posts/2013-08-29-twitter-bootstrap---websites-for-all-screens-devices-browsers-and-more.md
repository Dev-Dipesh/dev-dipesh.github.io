Maybe your job demands fast websites for clients to see and you can't waste time. 
Maybe you even are a talented artist, but you fight a never ending battle to make sure your website looks consistent in all browsers.

## Twitter Bootstrap 
### What is Twitter Bootstrap ? 
Twitter Bootstrap (mainly known as **Bootstrap** only) is a framework developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton when they were creating Twitter (that is why some people call it Twitter Bootstrap).

Bootstrap is a fast, intuitive and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It gives you all the tools you need to make websites, web applications and prototypes.

Bootstrap has template files, as well as a lot of optional JavaScript extensions that allow you to make modal windows, drop down menus, tab controls and carousel controls, which are all styled in advance, saving you from the trouble.

As if that was not enough, it also comes with styles for buttons, forms, tables,  typography and a collection of over 140 icons in both black and white versions.

Another very important feature of Bootstrap is that it comes with a 12 column grid system. If you don't know what that is, there is no problem - just know that it allows you to divide your website in equally spaced columns, thus making it look the same in all computers, with big screens, small screens, and even smartphones and tablets.
